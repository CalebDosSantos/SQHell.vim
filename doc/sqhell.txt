3. Filetypes                                                   *sqhell-filetypes*

SQHell comes with a few different filetypes for results to aid in
context aware operations.

Where possible the mappings available try to stick to Vim's semantics.

SQHTable                                                        *sqhell-sqhtable*
    The SQHTable view lists all tables for a given database.

    The following mappings are available

    e - Edit the table. It will SELECT 100 results from the table and display
        them to you.

        Note this opens a buffer with a filetype of SQHResult where more
        mappings will be (not currently) available.


SQHDatabase                                                  *sqhell-sqhdatabase*
    The following mappings are available

    e - Show the tables belonging to this database.

        Note this opens a buffer with a filetype of SQHTable
