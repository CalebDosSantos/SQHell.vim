SQHell - An SQL wrapper for vim

===============================================================================
1. Global Options                                                *sqhell-options*

Note It is strongly recommended that you keep your configuration in a separate
file outside of version control.

Once the plugin is installed, you will need to add a dictionary that can be
loaded called `g:sqh_connections`.

An example is given below containing multiple hosts

    let g:sqh_connections = {
        \ 'default': {
        \   'user': 'root',
        \   'password': 'testing345',
        \   'host': 'localhost'
        \},
        \ 'live': {
        \   'user': 'root',
        \   'password': 'gdfgee6Â£"^f',
        \   'host': '45.211.32.521'
        \}
    \}

By default, SQHell uses the 'default' key connection details.
In order to connect, each entry needs a 'user', 'password', and 'host' key.

g:sqh_connection                                              *sqhell-connection*

The host to connect to, the default is 'default'.

g:sqh_results_limit                                        *sqhell-results-limit*

How many entries to limit by when we view a tables results.
Default is 100

i.e. `let g:sqh_results_limit = 1000`

2. Commands                                                     *sqhell-commands*

SQHShowDatabases                                          *sqhell-show-databases*

    Arguments: none
    Example: SQHShowDatabases

    Shows all databases

SQHShowTablesForDatabase                        *sqhell-show-tables-for-database*

    Arguments: table name
    Example: SQHShowTablesForDatabase Users

    Shows all tables for a given database.
    Note This creates a buffer with a filetype of SQHTable.
    See 'sqhell-filetypes'

SQHExecuteFile                                              *sqhell-execute-file*

    Arguments: filename(optional)
    Example: SQHExecuteFile /tmp/delete-everything.sql
    Example: SQHExecuteFile

    Executes a given file as SQL.
    If a filename is given it executes that file, otherwise defaults to the
    buffer you are in ('%')

SQHExecuteCommand                                        *sqhell-execute-command*

    Arguments: command
    Example: SQHExecuteCommand SELECT * FROM users LIMIT 5

    Executes a given command as an SQL statement.
    It is case insensitive and you shouldn't quote the query.

SQHExecuteLine                                             *sqhell-execute-line*

    Arguments: none

SQHSwitchConnection                                   *sqhell-switch-connection*

    Arguments: connection name
    Example: SQHSwitchConnection live

    Switches the connection details to the given host specified
    in g:sqh_connections

3. Filetypes                                                   *sqhell-filetypes*

SQHell comes with a few different filetypes for results to aid in
context aware operations.

Where possible the mappings available try to stick to Vim's semantics.

SQHTable                                                        *sqhell-sqhtable*
    The SQHTable view lists all tables for a given database.

    The following mappings are available

    e - Edit the table. It will SELECT 100 results from the table and display
        them to you.

        Note this opens a buffer with a filetype of SQHResult where more
        mappings will be (not currently) available.


SQHDatabase                                                  *sqhell-sqhdatabase*
    The following mappings are available

    e - Show the tables belonging to this database.

        Note this opens a buffer with a filetype of SQHTable
